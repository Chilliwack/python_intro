# Introduction to Python

## Description

Description: This four-week course is designed to introduce attendees to Python programming and its broad applications.
Each two hour session will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises, and assumes attendees have
no prior computer coding experience. At the end of this course, you will be able to use Python to import, manipulate,
and visualize data.

## Resources

* Each week's materials are described in the Jupyter notebook prefaced with the number of the week.
* Data used for this lesson are identical to that used in [Introduction to R](https://github.com/fredhutchio/R_intro);
details on obtaining these data from the [National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons](https://gdc.cancer.gov)
can be found in that lesson repository.
* [`exercises/`](exercises) includes a file for each week representing both the aggregated in-class exercises as well as additional
supplemental exercises for practice
* [`solutions/`](solutions/) includes the solutions for all files in `exercises/`
* [`instructors.md`](instructors.md) includes information for instructors to facilitate teaching each lesson
* [`hackmdio.md`](hackio.md) is an archive of the [interactive webpage](https://hackmd.io) used during lessons
* Information about use of Python and Jupyter notebooks at Fred Hutch is available on the [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/software_python/)
